# Organelle-Segmentation-with-Detectron2
The project model was mask R-CNN model in detector2 library created by facebook. Detectron2 offers a number of popular models (e.g. Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN) and optimization servers (e.g. deformable folds) for end-to-end rendering detection and segmentation representation. It also includes a set of useful tools and helpful functions for training models, visualizing results, and examining the model.
